# JavaApplets
applets that I created using java(created gui, draws figures on a panel)
Using the applet library, awt, swing libraries,
I created multiple applets that drew figures on a JFrame panel, 
and created a car game with a basic UI to control the figures. 
Movement is done by mouse clicks and coordinate entering.
